Before running the project, some dependencies have to be installed,so first use:

## 'yarn install'

Then, to run the project use:

## 'yarn start'

The project will be opened on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in the browser.

To change the PORT, go to:

package.json -> scripts -> start

and change port number (removing 'set PORT=8888 &&' will set PORT to 3000 which is default).
